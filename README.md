Totorial: How to add a github repo and commit/push from VSCode
---

## **Step 1: Prerequisites**
Ensure you have:
- Git installed on your system.
- A GitHub account.
- VSCode installed and configured.

---

## **Step 2: Open Your Project Folder**
1. Open VSCode.
2. Go to **File > Open Folder** and select the folder containing your Python file.

---

## **Step 3: Initialize a Local Git Repository**
1. Open the **Source Control** panel by clicking the icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+G`.
2. Click on "Initialize Repository" if prompted. This will create a `.git` folder in your project, which tracks changes.

---

## **Step 4: Configure Git (One-Time Setup)**
If you haven't configured Git before, set your username and email:
1. Open the terminal in VSCode (`Ctrl+``).
2. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

---

## **Step 5: Stage and Commit Your Files**
1. In the Source Control panel, click the "+" icon next to your file to stage it (or click "Stage All Changes").
2. Enter a commit message (e.g., "Initial commit") in the input box at the top of the Source Control panel.
3. Click the checkmark icon (âœ”) or press `Ctrl+Enter` to commit your changes.

---

## **Step 6: Create a Repository on GitHub**
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
2. Click on **New Repository**.
3. Enter a name for your repository, choose public or private, and click **Create Repository**.

---

## **Step 7: Link Your Local Repository to GitHub**
1. Copy the repository URL from GitHub.
2. In VSCode's terminal, run:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin 
   ```
   Replace `` with the URL you copied.
3. Verify the remote link by running:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

---

## **Step 8: Push Your Code to GitHub**
1. In VSCode's terminal, push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   If your branch is named something other than `main`, replace it with your branch name.

---

## **Alternative Method: Use VSCode's GUI**
If you'd rather avoid using the terminal:
1. After initializing the repository, click on the ellipsis (`...`) in the Source Control panel.
2. Select **Push** or **Publish Branch**.
3. If prompted, add a remote repository by pasting your GitHub URL.

---

Once completed, refresh your GitHub repository page to see your files! Repeat Steps 5 and 8 for future changes.
